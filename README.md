This repository contains data and scripts used for collecting and preparing datasets for my research on the factors influencing the Global Peace Index. The goal is to compile and clean country-level data across various categories including economic, political, social, conflict, and military indicators.Data sources include publicly available datasets from institutions such as the World Bank, SIPRI, and other international organizations. All datasets will be cleaned and formatted for use in statistical and econometric analysis.Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or use parts of this project for related research.
